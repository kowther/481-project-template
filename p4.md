# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Executive Summary

Alberta is home to over 100 native and exotic wildflowers. We have developed an app prototype that allows people of all ages to discover and learn about these beautiful plants. The app is designed to be easy to use for passionate beginners while also having the detailed plant descriptions and large database that advanced amateurs desire. Its modern sleek look elevates the user experience and its simple design requires virtually no time spent in learning how to use it. 

We conducted three complementary investigations to better understand our target users. Reviewing currently available apps in a secondary research helped us to gather a significant volume of user experiences giving us great insight on specific user needs. We interviewed plant enthusiasts with the specific goal of finding out what tools they use to find information, and what they like or dislike about the resources that currently exist. Finally, we went out into the field with participants and had them test out a similar system to determine what worked, what didn’t work, and what they would like to see in a better app. 

From our findings, we produced the must have features for the app. After several cycles of sketching, storyboarding and prototyping we designed our final prototype. The stand out features of our app include uncluttered plant description pages that invites rather than deters users, two types of identification techniques, automatic one-click photo recognition and a manual plant characteristic selection, and a user log. The user log, in particular, is a feature we determined from our research to be desired but that has not been done before in this type of app.

We carried out a heuristic evaluation to uncover the problem areas we missed during our prototyping phase. Most of the major issues revolved around quick fixes in visibility of system status. We feel that our final prototype has a simple easy to use design while giving users plenty of options and maximizing learning. 


## Introduction

Alberta Wildflowers is a guide to identify, learn and share Alberta’s 100+ species of wildflowers. Enjoy all the familiarities of a traditional paper field guide, with more images and species information. Foster a community via the app, where users can share sightings, images and connect with each other.

Plants can be identified by either searching key plant characteristics (color, petal shape, etc) and location or by using our automatic photo recognition system. A user will be able to easily search through images to find a wildflower and any information related to it that they are looking for. Pictures taken and information about a plant’s location/characteristics can be shared with others by pinpointing sightings on a global map. This is a great feature for finding rarer species. 

This app is targeted to anyone interested in identifying wildflowers in Alberta. The text descriptions are easy enough for a beginner to understand but with the option to expand for more detailed scientific information for more advanced users.

Take this app out on an evening stroll in a nearby field or on a hike in one of Alberta’s national parks. With internet connection, you can share and update sighting locations on a map in real time, and use our automatic recognition tools. Or use the app offline with the searching key tool. People of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy and learn about Alberta’s stunning collection of wildflowers with this app.

## Design and Justification

Our final design was developed keeping in mind the data we collected from the investigation phase and the feedback we received from our storyboard and low-fi prototype. We incorporated the must have design elements including uncluttered description pages, two types of identification techniques and a user log. 

For the description pages, we chose to use headers for each section with the information hidden in drop-down sections, as opposed to having all of it displayed by default. This gives the user control over how much or how little information they want to access. A few key pieces of information, such as plant toxicity and species names are always visible on the screen. The two identification techniques give the user choice. The photo recognition identification technique is quick and easy to use, with just one click of a button. We modeled the camera screen after existing smartphone camera screens for familiarity. Identifying by manually choosing characteristics is another technique the user can use if the photo recognition does not give them results. We chose to display the selectable filters as images with the small text underneath to make the characteristic easier to recognize. The user log, My Collection, is a feature that separates this app from those currently on the market. It allows users to save their wildflower sightings. This feature makes the app personalizable where users can add/view additional images that they've taken of the flower. They can also add/view personal notes, or share their find on social media.

We feel that our final prototype has a simple easy to use design while giving users several options and maximizing information and learning. 


## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

In our heuristic evaluations we discovered numerous issues of varying severity. The issues were grouped based on the severity we assigned to them and we noticed that there was a pattern that evolved when we went over the results of the severity ratings. We noticed that the level 4 ratings were correlated with the heuristic user control and feedback and dealt with the user not being able to exit out of the state they are in if they no longer wished to be there or made a mistake. The fix for these issues included creating back buttons so that the user could access the previous state and make any adjustments or pick a different option.

Our level 3 and level 2 ratings were correlated with the heuristics match between system and the real world and visibility of system status and dealt with the user not being able to understand clearly how the functionality of the system works. We discovered though that the user would be more impacted by the level 3 issues than the level 2 issues. Therefore, the level 3 issues should be fixed before the level 2 issues. Fixes for the level 3 issues included adding more buttons for functionality, more images for identifying and making scrolling clear to the user. Fixes for level 2 issues included making the functionality clearer to the user through better placement and more real world representation. 

Our level 1 issues were correlated with the heuristics consistency and standards and recognition rather than recall and dealt with minor issues such as having the settings button on the right side of the screen and having icons that were a little bit more informative as to their purpose. While these issues are still important, the user can still use the system and understand what to do without any fixes. 

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

Our recommendations for the next iteration of the design would include an implementation of the map feature that we have the buttons set up for in the system. This would include having a map in which users could post their current location and sighting so that other users can see where they found the wildflower and find it there for themselves if they would like. The map would also have the sightings of other users so that the user can use the map to discover other wildflowers when they are in those areas kind of like a treasure hunt as users stated they would like to have this feature. 

Another feature we would recommend implementing in the next iteration of the design is the browse collection feature of the system. This would allow the users to browse a database of wildflowers to discover new ones, learn about them and then go and find them in the field. This database would be set up like the results page that is currently implemented but with other filters that would allow the user to search the database by name or characteristics.

A third feature we would recommend implementing in the next iteration of the design is the settings button on the front page. This would include setting up and editing a profile for the user and the information associated with that profile can be used when pinning sightings for other users to see. In the setting the user can also set their status to anonymous if they do not want to share their name.

The next iteration of the design should also implement the fixes we identified for issues we discovered in the heuristic evaluations that were completed.
