## Storyboard

![](https://kowther.github.io/FieldGuide-481/storyboard.jpg)

The storyboard showcases the three tasks the user can engage in once they have correctly identified a wildflower. ‘Pin to ‘Start’ allows the user to pin their location to a global map (1-4). Clicking on a pin displays the pinned sighting of all users at that specific location. The ‘Learn more’ task (5-6) gives the user a detailed description/interesting facts about their find. This is the traditional task associated with field guides. Lastly, the user can add their photo to their personal collection of sightings using ‘Add to My Wildflowers’ (7-9). Their photo is added to the end of the list. The user can then click on the photo, opening a drop-down page, where they can add/change a couple more images of that wildflower and add notes. Pressing the ‘home’ icon brings the user back to the main screen (10-11).

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

__Brainstorming Session__: Each group member came up with 7-8 sketches of various aspects of the system. The following are scans of each group member's brainstorming sketches (1 page per group member).

_Close up 1: Photo Storage_

We found that many of the current apps do not have the option of taking and storing your own photos of wildflower sightings. For our idea, we chose a grid layout as it allows for more items displayed at a time on the screen. Each item represents a photo taken of a flower sighting. The photos can be sorted by date found or by name.  The sketch illustrates that when a photo is clicked a drop-down page pops up. The page has the date, time, name of the flower, and space for notes. It has a button that takes you to the flower description page (not shown). It also has space for a few secondary photos of that plant (there is a limit of how many secondary photos). The user has the option of setting any photo as the primary photo. The photos can be saved onto the phone's storage or shared on social media.

_Close up 2: Description Page_

Based on our research done in P1 we found that potential users of a field guide app would like a description page that is oranginzed and not very cluttered. For this reason we decided that the most important information like the name of the flower should be available to the user right as they access the description page. Other more detailed information should be easily accessible by the user if they wish to learn more about the flower. This includes the full description, any interesting information about it and access to the map which shows the users locations of where to find the flower based on other users sightings and their own. In our research we discovered that some users are not interested in all of the facts about the flower and are just interested in knowing what it is, where to find it and the interesting facts about it, while other would like the more detailed description. In designing this page we decided that drop down menus would allow users to be able to acces the information if they wanted to and if not then it wouldn't be distracting to them. Also, we decided under the main image that the user should be able to swipe through the images again to keep the page organized and easily usable.

_Close up 3: Recognition Page_

This is the screen that the user sees when they want to identify their wildflower using image recognition. If they want to use their camera to take a new photo, a distinct box indicates the frame in which the user should position their view of the flower before pressing the ready button. Users also have the option to go to their Gallery/Camera Roll to use an image that they took before.

## Reflection

__EVERYONE__
We found that having more brainstorming sessions would have been helpful to get more ideas. We also felt that having more of the funnelling effect would have been beneficial. Having just one brainstorming session and then going right into the storyboard and the video prototype didn't give us as much time as we would have liked to generate a lot of ideas and then refine them and then create more ideas based on those and then refine again. The brainstorming was very helpful in generating different types of idea...
