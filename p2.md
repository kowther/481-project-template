# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

[Video Protoype Link](https://youtu.be/hGRAoFOrvsY)

For our video prototype, we created a PowerPoint video of our system. The video starts with the user taking a photo of a wildflower they would like to identify. The photo is analyzed with our photo recognition software to find a match. Once a match is found the user is then able to pick up to three tasks, pinning the wildflower to a map for others to view where the wildflower was sighted, adding the wildflower to a photo journal, and learning more by viewing its detailed description and interesting facts.

## Storyboard

The storyboard showcases the three tasks the user can engage in once they have correctly identified a wildflower. ‘Pin to Map’ allows the user to pin their location to a global map (1-4). Clicking on a pin displays the pinned sightings of all users at that specific location. The ‘Learn More’ task (5-6) gives the user detailed information about their find. This is the traditional task associated with field guides. Lastly, the user can add their photo to their personal collection of sightings using ‘Add to My Wildflowers’ (7-9). Their photo is added to the end of the list. The user can then click on the photo, opening a drop-down page, where they can add/change a few more images of that wildflower and add notes. Pressing the ‘home’ icon brings the user back to the main screen (10-11). (All wildflowers photos except the buffalo bean are from http://www.albertawow.com/wildflowers/alberta_wildflowers.htm#)

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

__Brainstorming Session__: Each group member came up with 7-8 sketches of various aspects of the system. The following are scans of each group member's brainstorming sketches (1 page per group member).

* [Page 2](https://kowther.github.io/FieldGuide-481/brainstorm_02.jpg)
* [Page 3](https://kowther.github.io/FieldGuide-481/brainstorm_03.jpg)

__Affinity Diagramming Session__: We organized each of the above sketches into 4 groups: main menu, identification techniques, journal/log/history, and individual flower descriptions.

_Close up 1: Photo Storage_

Many of the current apps do not have the option of taking and storing your own photos of wildflower sightings. Our researched showed that there is an interest in this type of feature. For our idea, once a user has identified a wildflower, they can store their photo in a photo journal. The sketch illustrates that when a photo is clicked a drop-down page pops up. The page has the date, time, name of the flower, and space for notes. It has a button that takes you to the flower description page (not shown). It also has space for a few secondary photos of that plant (there is a limit of how many secondary photos). The user has the option of setting any photo as the primary photo. The photos can be saved onto the phone's storage or shared on social media.

_Close up 2: Description Page_

Based on our research done in P1 we found that potential users of a field guide app would like a description page that is organized and not very cluttered. For this reason, we decided that the most important information like the name of the flower should be available to the user right as they access the description page. Other more detailed information should be easily accessible by the user if they wish to learn more about the flower. This includes the full description, any interesting information about it and access to the map which shows the users locations of where to find the flower based on other users’ sightings and their own. In our research, we discovered that some users are not interested in all the facts about the flower and are just interested in knowing what it is, where to find it and the interesting facts about it, while other would like the more detailed description. In designing this page, we decided that drop down menus would allow users to be able to access the information if they desired. Also, we decided under the main image that the user should be able to swipe through the images again to keep the page organized and easily usable.

_Close up 3: Recognition Page_

This is the screen that the user sees when they want to identify their wildflower using image recognition. If they want to use their camera to take a new photo, a distinct box indicates the frame in which the user should position their view of the flower before pressing the ready button. Users also have the option to go to their Gallery/Camera Roll to use an image that they took before.

## Reflection

__EVERYONE__
Having just one brainstorming session and then going right into the storyboard and the video prototype didn't give us as much time to go through several iterations to refine our ideas. Although the brainstorming session was very helpful in generating different types of idea, we couldn’t explore many different creative avenues. We focused our ideas on the results of our investigation in P1. We combine the brainstorming session with the affinity diagramming session. It helped us recognize the different visions that each group member had for different aspects of the system.

The storyboard came together easily because we were able to produce fairly complete tasks from the brainstorming session. We concentrated on the tasks involved after a correct identification of a wildflower as this gave us a range of tasks to explore instead of just the one identification task. 
NOT COMPLETE
- Talk about PowerPoint presentation pros/cons
- Talk about video prototype and the challenges with that. Paper one would have been ideal but lack of time forced us to go digital. 
- Couldn’t incorporate video into powerpoint
