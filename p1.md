_Justification:_ One of the best ways to determine what end users need in an app, is to have them use a similar system and then interview them to determine what worked, what didn’t work, and what they would like to see in a better app. Therefore, the Extreme User Interviews Research Method would be a great way to collect information in order to make a wildflower app that encompasses what different users of the app would want.

_Method Description:_ Two potential users were identified and were given an existing wildflower app and then were asked to describe their user experience with the app. First, before using the app, they were asked what their process would be for identifying a flower they had found. Next, they were given the app and asked to identity flowers using it. We watched how they used the app and then discussed with them afterwards about what they found worked well and what difficulties they encountered. Lastly, they were asked to be critical of the system and give insight into a better design for a wildflower app.

_Major Findings:_

Interviewee #1:

Brent, Male Adult, Average user of the following field guides: Birds, Dinosaur Bones, Rocks, Marine Life, and museums. Enjoys being outdoors and learning about things in nature that he discovers.

Grade the interviewee gave the app they tested: 8/10

What Worked:

* Able to narrow down results easily using predefined categories including time and place
* Served its purpose in identifying wildflowers
* Images are great as it allows him to confirm the flower he found is the same one
* After selecting certain aspects of the flowers, the results were narrowed down quickly
* Liked having all the options on one page

What Did Not Work:

* Not universal
  * He found that the app would be more meaningfully if the app could take his current location and then he could pick the type of flower     from the type of flowers that are in that area.
* Found the apps design not very appealing and very amateur looking. He would like an app that is more stylish with high usability.
* Found it was very cluttered
* Didn’t understand some of the habitat categories
* Didn’t know how to unselect an option he had chosen at first
  * Chose the yellow colour then was unsure of how to unselect it.
* Some flowers had more info than others
  * He found that one had Photos, Info, Map, Description, Links
  * A second one he found only had Info, Map, Links (no pictures to verify, or description)
* Felt like it was designed by someone with no artistic ability.
* Flower colours symbols are unclear.
  * Should be solid colours and have option to choose multiple colours.
* Alternative leaves is unclear
* Description has a lot of information that is not relevant to field guide users for identification purposes.
* Doesn’t like the links section. Doesn’t want to have to leave the app in order to get more information

Wish List for a new wildflower app:

* Rarity Colour Code: A colour coding system to determine rarity of flower. (Purple for super rare, red for rare…)
* Interesting facts about the flower. Should he be interested in it or not? Is it a national or provincial flower, healing properties
* Sharing it with others if it is rare or interesting
* Colour of the flower and location are the most important in identifying the flower.
* Is the flower poisonous, or are there similar looking flowers that might be potentially dangerous to touch, taste, smell, etc…

Interviewee #2:

Lorraine, Senior, Amateur User. Enjoys being outdoors and learning more about her surroundings. Uses field guides in book format at home to identify birds. Not tech savvy.

Grade the interviewee gave the app they tested: 7/10

What Worked:

* Description is very detailed
* Using images to identify
* Using number of petals, size, colour, structure, leaves to identify
* Served it’s purpose in identifying wildflowers

What Did Not Work:

* Map was not helpful at all
  * Very hard to determine where the flower was located
* Couldn’t see the images very well when choosing the types of leaves to narrow the search
* Unsure of how to use it. Touching or swiping on the screen, what buttons can be pressed.
* Missing a lot of text.
  * Doesn’t say items on screen can just be selected
  * Doesn’t say that you can select the flower to get more information
* Could be laid out better
* Easier to have it labeled
* Info and description are too similar. It is unclear of what each link it going to contain
* Links should be relevant to location and flower

Wish List for a new wildflower app:

* Are you able to collect it?
* Where did it get it’s name from
* Can you plant that certain type at home?
  * Info on planting:
    * Does it need lots of sun, water
    * Perennial or annual
* Pronunciation
* Is it edible? For animals and humans
* Is it poisonous?
* Tutorial on how to use it
* Send picture to friends/ family
* Take a picture and save it
* Individuals to contact to get more info
  
  
  
  
It was very interesting to see that the potential users identified a lot more issues and items they would like to see instead of what they actually liked about the system. We think that goes to show that when a design is good, people tend not to notice. But if the design is bad or missing items, it tends to stick out to users and hurt the overall experience. So determining things that didn’t work out is similar apps plays very important role in developing a better user-friendly app.  Being critical is very efficient in learning how to develop a better app. A list of items that were left out of similar apps is also helpful in designing our app.

### Reflections on User Research

_Extreme User Interviews:_ Using the Extreme User Interviews Research Method was very helpful in getting a lot of feedback about what user’s like, don’t like and what they would like to see differently in a wildflower app. Even with only two people interviewed, a lot of information was collected which will give us insight into designing the app. I believe having more time to contact different users would have been beneficial in collecting a wider range of likes and dislikes. Also, having multiple apps that the potential users could try would allow for more feedback in relation to different designs and have users find more key issues using different systems. It was easy to have the user explore the system in order to find issues and then evaluate their experience using it. I think the users were more critical of the system than they would have been if they didn’t know I was going to be asking about their experience with it. Also, since they knew we did not create the app, they were more willing to share their negative experiences with the wildflower app. If I had to do this research method again, I would like to give the potential users more time to use the app, so that they would not feel rushed and could have more time to give feedback.

## Task Descriptions

Brent is a tech savvy individual who enjoys being outdoors and learning about nature around him. He starts walking in Fish Creek Park and sees a flower that draws his attention. He wants to get out his field guide and determine the common name (doesn’t care about the scientific name), whether it is common or rare, if it is a native flower or if it was brought to this location by others, if it is invasive poisonous/harmful, any interesting facts or stories surrounding this flower (like corpse plant that doesn’t bloom annually and smells like rotting flesh). He would like to save an image of it with a date stamp, month, day, year, time and location and be able to share it to friends.

Lorraine is a senior who enjoys being outdoors and gardening. She sees a flower she likes in Glenmore Park and stops to take a picture. She wants to be able to identify it on the spot rather than take it home and look it up. She wants to be able to share it with friends and family and also save it to keep a record of what she has seen. She would also like to be able to determine whether she can plant it at home in her own garden. As she is not tech savvy, a tutorial to walk her through how to use the app would be beneficial.

Alyssa is a woman in her twenties who loves going on hikes. She goes on a hike and wants to be able to see multiple images of flowers and also see magnified images to distinguish certain flowers that may look alike. Since it’s hard to describe what she’s looking at she would like to be able to narrow down the search results using filters such as Colour and Number of Petals.
Wesley is a male in his twenties who likes going for walks. He sees a flower he would like to identify but it is not in full bloom. He would like to see images of the life stages of the flower in order to be able to identify the flower at different stages of it’s life correctly.

Mary is a mother who just took her family on a hiking trip. She took pictures on the trip and would like to add their sightings of specific flowers to a map. When adding the sightings she would like it to be added with the date she saw the wildflower rather than the date that she adds the sighting. She would rather have it show the date the sighting occurred so that when using the app to check for sightings they are more accurate.  So maybe a date editing button would be useful.

Paul is teenager who enjoys researching flowers. He goes to parks and finds flowers that he likes and would like to add his favourites to a list so that he can keep track of them and be able to bring up the description of it easily at a later time.
