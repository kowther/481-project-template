Users have the option to identify wildflowers using either photo recognition or manually selecting characteristics of the wildflower. When identifying using photo recognition, the user positions the camera to get the wildflower in the view of the green box. Then they take the photo and the system attempts to identify the wildflower. When identifying by manually choosing characteristics, the user touches a characteristics to apply the filter and hopefully narrow down the possibilities. At any time, they can click on the Results button at the bottom of the screen to see the currect matches from the filters applied so far.

Once the user has identified the wildflower, they are able to learn more about it. They can read a more detailed description of the flower, interesting facts, and where in the world it can be found. Users also have the option to add the wildflower to My Collection, which acts as a journal of all the user's findings. They choose a primary photo for this wildflower's page in their journal.

The user can also scroll through My Collection to view all of the wildflowers they have found and saved. They can click on the image of the wildflower to add/view additional images or personal notes, or share their find on social media.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

After discussing our individual heuristic evaluations, we came up with a set of 11 heuristics (shown in the table below) that were ranked by decreasing severity. Interestingly we found some patterns within the data. Level 1 dealt with minor recognition problems. Level 2 and 3 issues were mainly due to our system not matching the real world or visibility of system status. Level 4 issues were all due to a lack of user control and freedom, and had to do with not being able to go back from the current page or state. We felt that the user would not be able to overcome these issues if presented with them and thus an immediate fix was necessary. The rest of this section will focus on level 3-4 issues.

What differentiated level 3 issues from level 2 were how much the user experience would be impacted by these problems. The results and my collection pages have scrollable content but do not have a scroll bar on the side to indicate that scrolling is possible. The way these pages are laid out it is not clear that there are more rows of images below. This was given a visibility of system status rating. It can be easily fixed by adding a scrollbar on the side. A match between system and real world issue we encountered was that the camera page did not have all the normal buttons and functionality that most mobile phone cameras have, such as a flash button. Adding the necessary camera functionalities would fix this issue. A good field guide would have images of each plant at different stages of growth. This way a user can identify a flower that is not in full bloom. Our wildflower database only shows images in full bloom. We rated this a match between system and real world issue. It can be fixed by adding information about plants when not in bloom.
